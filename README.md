# 🗂️ arch-dotfiles

My personal **Arch Linux dotfiles**.

Minimal, functional, and constantly evolving.  
Mostly focused on workflow, aesthetics, and keeping things simple.

## ✨ What’s inside

- 🖥️ Window manager & desktop configs

- 🔧 Application configs (terminal, editor, etc.)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These dotfiles are **opinionated** and tailored to **my setup**.  
Use as reference, not a one-click install.
